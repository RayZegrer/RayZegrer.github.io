										<p>Two drawings that I did during Art Fight 2023, an annual art game that runs every July where artists are
										put into two teams and collect points by drawing art of the opposing teams' characters. (Note: These character 
											designs do not belong to me, only the art itself.)</p>
										
										<img src="images/IHReflection.png" width=75% height=auto alt="" class="centerimg"/>	
										<p>An assignment for a course on critical perspectives on the body, the assignment was to do a reflection based on the book Indian Horse
										by Richard Wagamese. The drawing takes inspiration from tarot and oracle cards, contrasting the ideas of loss and healing. It features 
										the phases of the moon that are symbolized in the book and various plants that were used in medicine. </p>

										<h3>Traditional Materials</h3>

										<img src="images/FoamMask.jpg" width=60% height=auto alt="" class="centerimg"/>
										<p>Mask and arm made primarily out of EVA foam, a common material used in cosplay due to its versatility and ability to be heat formed. 
										For the mask, I made a template using paper on a foam mannequin head and then transferred the pattern to the foam, cutting it out and using 
										contact cement to bind the pieces together; a heat gun was used to bend the foam to shape. Moldable foam was used for the horns and a wood burner
										to add details and weathering. The entire thing was then hand painted. For the arm, I used fabric to make the underlying glove which is hand sewed, 
										a similar process was used, with the exception of hot glue being used to bind the foam pieces to the glove. </p>
										
										<img src="images/Leather.jpg" width=60% height=auto alt="" class="centerimg"/>
										<p>This is a leather mask that I made many years ago when I was in highschool, after being cut out, the leather was submerged in water then baked on 
										and off as the form was shaped.</p>
										
										<img src="images/RWBB_charm.jpg" width=60% height=auto alt="" class="centerimg"/>
										<p>A wooden charm of a redwing blackbird that was made for a friend. The overall shape was cut out by hand and the details carved using a dremel. The bird was 
										painted and given two layers of sealant. </p>

									     		<div class="pictures"> <img src="images/hammerClose.jpg" width=100% height=auto alt=""/> </div>
									   	</div>
										<p>This hammer was made based off a D&D character of mine that comes from a steampunk fantasy campaign. The entire base was made out of a single plank of wood, 
										the head being constructed of several stacked circles which where then sanded down, and the handle being cut out from the plank and also sanded down by hand. 
										The handle and hammer head are interlocking and fairly sturdy. The gear and smaller details were made out of polymer clay, and the hand grips are wrapped twine. 
										The purple accents were made by carving out channels in the wood, painting the inside, then filling it with hot glue. The entire thing was then painted. </p>
